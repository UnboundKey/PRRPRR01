# C++ Training exorcise #

I did this to get my feet wet with C++ which i've never used before. It was kind of difficult before i had any idea of what i was doing (I couldn't even create a string) but now i think i understand the basics of getting input and output though the terminal. Even though this only writes to the terminal. I did experiment with getting input from the user as well but decided to scrap it as i just wanted to show this of for now.

In conclution this is basicaly my hello world of C++. and if you want to try it there should be a working link to click on to try the code in your browser
